# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This README provides a concise overview of our project management approach and links to the detailed process documents kept in this folder to help new and existing teammates find what they need quickly.

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes
- Customer-first, iterative delivery — we continuously validate impact with customers and iterate quickly.
- Clear PM and Product Lead ownership — defined accountability for outcomes and decisions.
- Data-informed decisions — use metrics, experiments, and qualitative feedback to guide tradeoffs.
- Psychological safety and feedback culture — teams are encouraged to surface concerns and learn from failures.
- Core lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective — each phase has associated artifacts and responsibilities.
